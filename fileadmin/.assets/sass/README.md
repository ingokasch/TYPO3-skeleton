SASS/SCSS resources
===================

In most cases you want to use the "_" underscore as file name prefix to prevent the Sass compiler from rendering every .scss file into css. A common way is
to use the Sass @import statement to import .scss files into one single file. This file will then be compiled to css and placed in the fileadmin/css folder.
