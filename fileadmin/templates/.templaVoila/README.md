TemplaVoila! Resources
======================

This sceleton supports you in storing your TemplaVoila! data structures in the file system instead of storing it in the database.

To use static files for data structures please configure your TemplaVoila!-Extension as follows:

*   Enable - *Enable static files for data structures*
*   FCE Data Structure Path* needs to be set to `fileadmin/templates/.templaVoila/fce/`
*   Page Data Structure Path* needs to be set to `fileadmin/templates/.templaVoila/page/`
